# google_play_store_scraping
In this project, I share with you the web crawling code of three databases. One containing the meta data of apps, the second the reviews on a dataset of applications and the permission dataset. 
This scraping project was executed in two steps: 
1- scraping IDs of applications 
2- using google play store's API to get the meta-data, reviews and permissions. 
you will find in the spiders folder links.py which scrapes links, scrapMongo.py scrapes data into mongodb. 
I will share later the found databases after a cleaning process.
